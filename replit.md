# Cybersecurity Portfolio Project Documentation

## Overview

This is a comprehensive cybersecurity penetration tester portfolio website with full content management capabilities. The project features a professional dark-themed design with animations, a public portfolio showcase, blog system, and a hidden admin interface for complete content management.

**Current Status**: Import paths fixed and application ready for deployment
**Primary Purpose**: Professional cybersecurity portfolio with blog and admin content management

## System Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 19 with TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express, TypeScript
- **Database**: In-memory storage with Drizzle ORM schema (ready for PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication**: JWT-based admin authentication with bcrypt
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with custom cybersecurity theme
- **Deployment**: Replit hosting platform

### Key Features Implemented
- **Public Portfolio**: Professional cybersecurity-themed landing page with animations
- **Blog System**: Public blog with search, categories, and rich content display
- **Admin Interface**: Hidden admin panel accessible via `/admin` URL only
- **Content Management**: Full CRUD operations for all website content
- **Authentication**: Secure admin login with credential management
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with dark cybersecurity theme

## Key Components

### Existing Components
- `.replit` configuration file (currently empty)

### Future Components (To Be Implemented)
- Application entry point
- Core business logic
- User interface components
- Data models and schemas
- API endpoints (if applicable)
- Authentication system (if required)

## Data Flow

**Current State**: No data flow implemented

**Future Considerations**:
- User input handling
- Data processing and validation
- Storage and retrieval operations
- Response generation and delivery

## External Dependencies

### Current Dependencies
- Replit platform services
- Basic runtime environment

### Potential Future Dependencies
- Package managers (npm, pip, etc.)
- External APIs and services
- Third-party libraries and frameworks
- Database services (potentially PostgreSQL if using Drizzle ORM)

## Deployment Strategy

### Current Setup
- Hosted on Replit platform
- Automatic deployment on code changes
- Built-in development and production environments

### Future Deployment Considerations
- Environment variable management
- Database migration strategies
- Static asset handling
- Performance optimization
- Monitoring and logging

## Data Flow

### Portfolio Content Management
```
Admin Login → JWT Auth → Admin Dashboard → Content CRUD → In-Memory Storage
                                       ↓
Public Website ← Portfolio API ← Content Retrieval ← Storage Interface
```

### Blog Management System
```
Admin Interface → Blog Editor → Content Validation → Storage
                                      ↓
Public Blog ← Blog API ← Published Posts Filter ← Storage
```

### Authentication Flow
```
Admin Credentials → bcrypt Verification → JWT Token → Protected Routes
```

## External Dependencies

### Current Dependencies
- **React 19**: Modern frontend framework with hooks and JSX
- **Express 5**: Backend server framework for API routes
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **Framer Motion**: Animation library for smooth transitions
- **Drizzle ORM**: Type-safe database schema definitions
- **JWT**: Secure admin authentication tokens
- **bcrypt**: Password hashing for security
- **Zod**: Runtime type validation and schema parsing

### Replit Platform Services
- Automatic deployment and hosting
- Environment variable management
- Built-in development tools and terminal

## Deployment Strategy

### Current Setup
- **Frontend**: Vite development server (port 3000) with hot reload
- **Backend**: Express server (port 3001) with TypeScript compilation
- **Database**: In-memory storage with sample cybersecurity content
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with 24-hour expiration
- **Admin Access**: Hidden `/admin` route (no public navigation)

### Production Considerations
- Environment variables for JWT secrets
- Database migration to PostgreSQL (schema ready)
- Static asset optimization through Vite build
- HTTPS enforcement for security
- Content backup and recovery procedures
